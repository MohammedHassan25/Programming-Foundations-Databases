# One-to-many relationships: It connects one piece of data, one row of a table to one or more other pieces of data.
# Using a one-to-many relationship doesn't require many ends to have a lot of instances.
# There could just be two different values on the many sides, or even one. The point is that this relationship allows one record to be associated with many records.
