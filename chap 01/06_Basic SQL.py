# A common language used to do database is called SQL (often called Sequel)
# SQL stands for the structured query language
# Most relational database management system tools, also called RDBMS tools, support ANSI SQL.
# Though many tools offer their own flavor or version of the language that extends ANSI SQL to add features specific to that DBMS.
# Two examples of this are T-SQL or Transact-SQL used by Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL, an open-source DBMS that includes a few other useful features on top of the SQL standard
# SQL allows us to write statements which the DBMS interprets, and that's how we interact with the data in the database, from apps, or even within the DBMS itself
# SQL is called a data manipulation language, or DML.
# SQL also offers features to manage the database itself by creating and modifying tables and controlling access to tables
# In SQL, it's common to see the keywords written in uppercase, though it's not strictly necessary.
