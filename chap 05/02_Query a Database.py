# Depending on the DBMS you're using, the way you set up and enforce this relationship will be different.
# Once a schema is in place we need to use SQL as a data manipulation language to work with the data itself.
# A query returns specific information that we ask for.
# From a database we'll use the select statement. This tells the database we want to see information from specific fields.
# The select clause allows us to return data from the tables in our database and it acts as a starting point for making more complex and detailed queries as well.
# We can use the WHERE clause to choose only specific records or records which match our criteria.
# The percent is the placeholder for one character.
# The count function takes the name of a field and tells us how many rows that match our criteria have a value in that field.
# (Sum) adds up all the values of the matching criteria
# We can also get an average of values with the AVG keyword.
# We can get the minimum and maximum values in a column with min and max.
# We can use the JOIN keyword to tell the database to consider two tables.
