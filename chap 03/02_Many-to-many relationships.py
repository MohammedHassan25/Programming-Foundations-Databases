# a many-to-many relationship is useful when we want to associate more than one thing with more than one other thing.
# In most DBMS tools, we can't model a many-to-many relationship directly, so we need to create a linking table, which has a one-to-many relationship with both of the tables we want to use.
# Many-to-many relationships are fairly common, but they're really made up of one-to-many relationships with the addition of a linking table.
