# Just like in a book, tables in a database can have indexes, where you can look up information quickly.
# Transactions group queries or statements into a block of activities, where, if one of the components fails for any reason, the whole group of statements is not executed, and anything that's partially done is rolled back.
# A stored procedure is kind of like a program you write that's stored on the database server.
# A stored procedure contains a series of commands that you can then reference and use when you interact with the database.
# Stored procedures are also used to provide safe or approved ways of dealing with sensitive data.
