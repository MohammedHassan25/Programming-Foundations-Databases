# Second Normal Form (2NF): No value in a table should depend on only part of a key that can be used to uniquely identify a row.
# This means that for every column in the table that isn't a key, each of the values must rely on only the whole key.
# The values must describe something about that row that we can't determine from just the part of a key.
